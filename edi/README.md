The B2B transaction process between carriers and broker partners was for a long time based on exchange of paper.
EDI made the design, implementation, manufacture or application of systems for electronic data interchange within the insurance industry possible.
CSIO published standards applicable to electronic data interchange.
The EDI standard defined defined the communications procedure and message formats for agent/broker company data communications within the insurance industry.
These standards enhanced data communications between independent insurance agents/brokers and the companies they represent.
They providied the functional specifications for hardware and software interface system components that could be employed in a variety of interface arrangements.
Data found on Forms was the basis for developing the data required in the initial transactions.
Thus EDI has facilitated “frictionless” commerce, helped to eliminate manual paper processes, and delivered significant and persistent broad supply chain efficiencies through automation.
