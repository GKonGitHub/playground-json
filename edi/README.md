The B2B transaction process between carriers and broker partners was for a long time based on exchange of paper.
EDI made the design, implementation, manufacture or application of systems for electronic data interchange within the insurance industry possible.
CSIO published standards applicable to electronic data interchange.
The EDI standard defined defined the communications procedure and message formats for agent/broker company data communications within the insurance industry.
These standards enhanced data communications between independent insurance agents/brokers and the companies they represent.
They providied the functional specifications for hardware and software interface system components that could be employed in a variety of interface arrangements.
Data found on Forms was the basis for developing the data required in the initial transactions.
Thus EDI has facilitated “frictionless” commerce, helped to eliminate manual paper processes, and delivered significant and persistent broad supply chain efficiencies through automation.
EDI was developed in a era of batch processing. This format cannot be used for real time B2B communications.
EDI is not designed to handle events from new kinds of users like IoT sensor or digital cameras and is a protocol that is file based.
Periodic data exchange is possible, but not continuous data exchange.
Expanding EDI with Application Programming Interface capabilities enables a more flexible B2B integration.


API vs EDI 
APIs connects directly to applications while EDI requires a file transfer server
A{Is connect directly to the Broker/ Policy management system , eliminating the need for a file transfer server and associted processes,
API driven transactions require less memmorty, compute and storage resources nd can be secured using a wide variety of encryption and authentication mechanisms.
APIs enable realtime exchange while EDI enables periodic echange of data.
Business having establised EDI practices in place do not need to invest in separate infrastructure for realtime collaboration with trading partmers.
Companies need to support both a core set of EDI transaction types and API capabilities or risk missing out on important opportunities to drive revenue, growth and competitive differentiation.

Big 3 emerging technologies : IoT, Blockchain, AI 

The challenge is to find ways to build on existing technologies and investments like EDI.

Today, we are seeing existing and emerging Vendors and Insurance compaines leveraging IoT, AI and Blockchain . How will these technologies complement EDI and API integration?

The business of insurance relies on multi party collaboration.

In the coming years, organizations - brokers, vendors and carrier must work together to achieve shared goals and outcomes that deliver a superior end to end experience.

CSIO provides information, developed through a process of industry wide consensus, which defines communications procedure and message formats for agent/broker company data communications within the insurance industry. These Standards are designed to enhance data communications between independent insurance agents/brokers and the companies they represent by providing functional specifications for hardware and software interface system components that can be employed in a variety of interface arrangements. Over the years CSIO has emerged as the de facto orgnization enabling multi party collaboration.
